# code-signal-tasks
This repository was made to keep code signal arcade mode tasks resolutions. It's part of my studies to learn Ruby.

The structure will be:

Main folders -> Those folders are the levels of the tasks.

Secundary folders -> Those folders will be one folders for each task. Which folder will have a txt file with the description of the task and the resolution using ruby.
